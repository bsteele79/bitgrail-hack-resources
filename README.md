# BitGrail Hack

On 02 / 09 / 2018 21:30 UTC The Bitgrail cryptocurrency exchange, Bitgrail S.r.l. (http://bitgrail.com) announced:

"Bitgrail S.r.l. Informs its users that internal checks revealed unauthorized transactions which led to a 17 million Nano shortfall, an amount forming part of the wallet managed by Bitgrail S.r.l."

This repository is here to help recover as much of the funds lost as possible to the users who have lost funds and to help BitGrail customers make an informed decision about what legal steps they should take.

## Why is this resource here?

To help recover funds or help with legal claims to recover funds.

There is a lot of information spread over forums, social media, reddit. This is a place where we can collect it all together to provide a valuable resource for Legal and Criminal agencies.

## How you can help

We can all help each other to collect information and form a strategy about what needs to be done to recover funds. 

If you are not familiar with the way GitHub works then you can submit the informaition to bitgrail-resources@harwood-leon.com with an explanation of why you think it could be useful to include

You can also:

- request access to the repository as a collaborator (supply your github username)
- submit a pull request with your changes
- contribute to one of the collaborative documents

## What should be included

_A timeline/history of events_ 

If we can piece together the events leading up to the alledged hack then we can start to understand where the missing XRB tokens have gone and why they were lost.

_Links to other relevant documents or resources_

See Links.md

_Logs_

Transaction logs, chat logs, tweets, public and relevant private communications. 

_Legal resources_

We can learn from previous exchange hacks like MtGox and quickly mobilise and do the most effective thing. Legal strategy and advice now would be really helpful. I have a few people I know who are researchers in Law and may be able to give us a strategy. 

_Anything else_

There are a few ways that people who lost on MtGox mobilised to try to claim funds. We can learn from the good and bad things that happened there.

we should discuss how to set up a register of losses, so we can report to the media accurate information too. Let's use the Law wisely, not turn into a baying mob. If the owners of the company are hurt, we may not see anything at all.


## What won't be included

_Personal threats_ 

Against anyone (especially threats to kill) may get you in real trouble with your own local legal force, this is a public resource. I don't think it helps either. Sure, like me you are angry, but I just want to retrieve as much as possible from this situation, however small - let's focus on that. 

_Personally identifiable information_

No information like balances and addresses that can be linked to users. We don't want this to be a resource for another hack. Also, we are dealing with Bitgrail S.r.l., the company - not the employees or any other users. The company owners may have acted illegaly, but that is not the purpose of this resource to get a criminal conviction. Any civil claim will probably be against the company and not the individuals. The evidence and information we uncover may be used to help a criminal conviction in the future, but that is not what this resource is here to do - we are simply interested in reclaiming funds.

_Slanderous information_

Until a full audit is done by a trusted, independent authority we cannot know what has really happened. So we cannot assert that anyone has done anything yet. This resource is for information, the authorites can do the rest.

## Disclaimer and liabilities

IMPORTANT While this public resource is being provided, we can't claim a) it's accuracy and b) that anyone will have funds reclaimed. We make our best efforts to provide information available, but we make no claim this resource will eventaully help recover funds in any way and will not be liable for losses incurred as a result of using the information contained. Using or contributing to this resource means you understand and agree to these terms.

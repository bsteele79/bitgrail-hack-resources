Here's a template for reporting this as a crime in the UK

https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report-a-fraud-including-online-crime-questions

To fill in this form:

- Bitgrail s.r.l an organisation as "suspect" 
- Mr Francesco Firano as a individual "suspect" also.

In the "additional information" section of "fraud details":

"On 9th February 2018 the Italy-based cryptocurrency exchange, owned and run by Francesco Firano (of Signa, Florence), announced that 17 million NANO cryptocurrency coins were missing - suggested stolen by a hacker.

These coins were WORTH APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION - which means this would be one of the largest individual cyber theft events in the world - and certainly the largest in Europe.

Additionally there are suspicions in the investor community that this crime could be an "inside job" - or at the very least it is clear from a pattern of unusual behaviour from Mr Firano in the weeks leading up to the announcement that he knew about the missing cryptocurrency for some time - but kept it quiet and continued to let customers invest money on an exchange that he knew was insolvent.

At this time it looks like all funds are lost and investors will lose all their money. There will certainly be a significant number of UK investors who have fallen victim to this theft, potentially costing UK victims millions. We would appreciate UK police following up with police in Italy who should be investigating this crime. We are also concerned that many of us had uploaded personal details for KYC/AML checks which included ID, proof of address etc - and would like to know that our personal information is secure. The NANO investor community can be contacted via the forum www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency where there have also been posts from those knowledgeable in cryptocurrency regarding their own investigation on the movement, timing and destination of the funds taken from Bitgrail."

I have seen the threads in this sub about suspicious transactions on the chain from BitGrail TO Mercatox. Which were very helpful and gave me a place to start: https://redd.it/7wiimg

From that I have come across evidence that Bitgrail AND Mercatox were BOTH SENDING MILLIONS of NANO to the SAME addresses…at the SAME time…..As you can see some of these amounts came directly from BitGrail Representative 1 which is suppose to be “Bomber’s” cold wallet…..and during a time we were told that withdrawals were either frozen or unavailable by both sites:

Between January 17th-19th Bitgrail AND Mercatox sent these addresses millions worth of NANO LINKS:

During this time, the NANO development team had updated/corrected the Node issue and worked with Kucoin to get them up and running....but on the other hand, Mercatox would not respond, and Bitgrail (Bomber) refused any help per the developer update on 01/18/2018:

“Since then 'we' (I) have been monitoring the node via the block explorer and its working well - it has been for the last few days a matter of waiting for them to open up their withdrawals - something that we don't have any control over apart from to regularly contact them and explain the situation - we've recently been trumped by Ethereum issues. As has been mentioned before help has been offered to the Bitgrail team however they felt that they had things under control and report that they are working on internal scripting…..”

Why was Francesco refusing assistance and rather shutdown all withdrawals when the node was working fine according to the development team? Was he afraid what they would find? On his “Update” announcement on 1/18 he says he doesn’t want to be a “guinea pig”…

NANO is by far the most popular and transacted coin on Mercatox but they wouldn’t communicate with the development team at all? ….odd.

Why were MILLIONS worth NANO being sent from Mercatox AND Bitgrail to the SAME addresses at the SAME time while withdrawals were either frozen or closed by both exchanges?

Have we heard from Mercatox at all? The last announcement on their Twitter is back on January 19th. You would think they would at least make a statement saying they are working with the team or their funds are safe.

Binance and Kucoin have both made statements to the NANO team offering their support on this issue:

I am still looking through whatever I can find, but please share any information you may have so we can work together on this. Please let me know what you think. Thanks.

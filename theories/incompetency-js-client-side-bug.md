BitGrail lost $170 million worth of Nano XRB tokens because... the checks for whether you had a sufficient balance to withdraw were only implemented as client-side JavaScript

first off this was the bug

" There was a bug, on the withdraw page.

But this check was only on java-script client side, you find the js which is sending the request, then you inspect element - console, and run the java-script manually, to send a request for withdrawal of a higher amount than in your balance.

Bitgrail delivered this withdrawal.

How many people did this? Who knows. This bug was later closed.

There was another bug, you could request a withdrawal to your address - from another userId, from another user-account. That would cause the other users balance to have "missing funds" or "negative balance". Bitgrail bomber solved this bug by manually entering the "correct" numbers in his database.

This is what you get for using a PHP website coded by same skill-level as CfB of IDIOTA."

Bomber started selling the XRB to cover these losses.

Most of the missing XRB has been traced to Kucoin and Mercatox. It was 100% sold there for other cryptos. There is literally no reason for it to be pulled back out as XRB; and if it was you would see some of these larger withdrawals out of those exchanges - which you don't.
